Nissan hired Carbon Five to research and test how families could co-own vehicles as a new tech-powered business model. Working with a small team of engineers and researchers, we designed and ran a month-long experiment with 50 families, built a custom GPS data dashboard, and prototyped an iOS app to manage car sharing.

- Validated car sharing hypothesis with real-world data
- Built custom analytics dashboard tracking utilization, heatmaps, and trip routes
- Designed and coded interactive iOS prototype in Framer JS
- Delivered tested artifacts to Nissan that secured executive investment for future development
