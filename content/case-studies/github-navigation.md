GitHub's navigation couldn't scale—users got lost in the hierarchy, core features were buried in menus, and the UI wasn't accessible. I led a cross-functional team of 20+ to redesign the navigation from the ground up, introducing a two-level system (sidebar + tabs) that reflects GitHub's information architecture and meets accessibility standards.

- Achieved >95% user satisfaction across 150M+ users
- Reduced React UI rendering time by 38% and CPU usage by 72%
- Scaled Primer design system adoption from 9% to 90% of core surfaces
- Enabled integration of Copilot AI features across the platform
- Coordinated 20+ designers, engineers, and PMs through 3-month public beta
- Established analytics tracking standards adopted org-wide
