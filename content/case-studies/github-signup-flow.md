GitHub's signup process took 142 seconds and was filled with friction. With Copilot's Free tier launching and competitive pressure mounting, I led the New User Experience team through systematic optimization: redesigned the UI, added globally-compliant onboarding email opt-in, integrated Google/Apple social login, and reduced friction to near-zero clicks for new users originating from VS Code.

- Increased daily signups by 63%
- Reduced signup time by 89% for social signups
- Achieved 40% email opt-in rate despite complex global compliance
- Drove 14% higher engagement among new users that received onboarding emails
- Coordinated authentication, legal, marketing, and platform health teams
- 60%+ of signups now use social login vs. traditional form
