GitHub's home dashboard had a reputation problem—2M daily users called it "useless" and relied on browser bookmarks instead. I redesigned it with separate "My Work" and "Feed" tabs, added Copilot agent orchestration, and shipped iteratively (5% preview → community feedback → 100% at GitHub Universe).

- Achieved >95% user satisfaction with 2M daily active users
- Fixed long-standing perception problem: "I was waiting for this since ages!"
- Gained 10k+ daily users during public preview with overwhelmingly positive feedback
- Users clicked PRs 5x more than Issues (validated prioritization decisions)
- Integrated Copilot agent orchestration for AI-assisted task management
- Shifted Feed vs. My Work usage from 2:1 to 3:2 as users learned new pattern
