70% of new users churned within two weeks because they were new to git and programming. The old onboarding dashboard was overwhelming: users didn't know where to start. After extensive user research, I led a redesign with a focused, educational-first experience: YouTube video series, engagement checklist, and beginner docs.

- Reduced cognitive load for new users with clear, progressive path forward
- Increased engagement and boosted Monthly Engaged Users (MEU) among new signups
- Drove increase in new user engagement with strategic features like Copilot and VS Code downloads
