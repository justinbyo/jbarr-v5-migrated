Primer was in crisis—only 9% adoption, unclear roadmap, and teams were building duplicate components (3 different date pickers). I reset the product strategy by prioritizing high-impact React components, created a "shared component library" as a middle layer between Primer and custom code, and authored the org-wide strategy guide that became the source of truth for 100+ engineers.

- Grew Primer adoption from 9% to 90% across GitHub's core UI
- Scaled shared React component library by 7x through inner-sourcing model
- Authored canonical Shared Component Strategy guide used by 100+ GitHub engineers
- Consolidated duplicate implementations (3 date pickers → 1, multiple lists → 1)
- Conducted listening tour with 7 product teams to identify adoption blockers
- Enabled Copilot AI experiences that required new component patterns not in Primer yet
