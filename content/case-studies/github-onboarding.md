70% of new users churned within two weeks because they were new to git and programming. The old onboarding dashboard was overwhelming—users didn't know where to start. After extensive user research, I rebuilt it with a focused, educational-first experience: YouTube video series, engagement checklist, and beginner docs.

- Reduced cognitive load for new users with clear, progressive path forward
- Increased engagement and boosted Monthly Engaged Users (MEU) among new signups
- Positive qualitative feedback: "I finally understand what to do next"
- Prioritized educational content: YouTube basics, first-action checklist, setup guides
- Conducted extensive user research to identify root causes of churn
- Designed for users brand new to both git and programming (70% of churned users)
