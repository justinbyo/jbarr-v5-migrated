As Signal Sciences scaled from 30 to 500+ customers ahead of its $825M acquisition, I owned the platform's core functionality and evolved it to meet enterprise needs.

- Prepared platform for 40,000 apps monitoring 2 trillion requests/month
- Redesigned dashboard and navigation for large, complex enterprise instances
- Added roles, permissions, authentication methods, and IDP integrations
- Reduced support tickets by 12% and improved sales conversion
- Increased marketing and sales conversion rates through targeted featureset improvements and experiments
