Competitors like Graphite and Linear were entering the market with better PR management UIs. Users couldn't quickly answer "Am I blocking teammates?" or "Where are my PRs in the lifecycle?" I redesigned the PR dashboard with status-based grouping, custom filtering, and clear next-action suggestions inspired by Gerrit attention sets.

- Achieved competitive feature parity with Graphite and Linear
- Introduced status-based grouping: "Needs your review," "Your PRs," "Waiting on others"
- Added custom views: filter by org, repo, team, project, or timespan
- Suggested next actions with clear CTAs ("Approve," "Address feedback," "Merge")
- Rebuilt UI architecture from the ground up for better scalability
- Early feedback shows improved clarity on PR status and blocking relationships
