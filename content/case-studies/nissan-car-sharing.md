Nissan wanted to validate whether families could successfully co-own vehicles using digital tools. I designed and ran a month-long experiment with 50 families, built a custom GPS data dashboard, and prototyped an iOS app in Framer JS. The research revealed that communication and conflict avoidance were critical—leading to a design where the app acts as a neutral middleman.

- Validated car sharing hypothesis with real-world data from 50 families
- Built custom analytics dashboard tracking utilization, heatmaps, and trip routes
- Designed and coded interactive iOS prototype in Framer JS
- Key insight: Co-owners avoid confrontation—app mediates conflicts to prevent bad feelings
- Delivered tested artifacts that secured executive investment for future development
- Matched family pairs based on complementary vs. similar schedules to test hypotheses
