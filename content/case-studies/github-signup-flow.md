GitHub's terminal-style signup took 142 seconds and wasn't accessible. With Copilot Free launching and competitive pressure mounting, I led the New User Experience team through systematic optimization: redesigned the UI, added globally-compliant email opt-in, integrated Google/Apple social login, and reduced friction to near-zero clicks for VS Code users.

- Increased daily signups by 63% (85k → 140k users)
- Reduced signup time by 89% (142 seconds → 16 seconds for social logins)
- Achieved 40% email opt-in rate (~1.2M users/month) despite complex global compliance
- Drove 14% higher engagement and 21% lower inactivity among email recipients
- Coordinated authentication, legal, marketing, and platform health teams
- 60%+ of signups now use social login vs. traditional form
