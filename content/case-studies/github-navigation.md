GitHub's navigation couldn't scale: users got lost in the hierarchy, core features were buried in menus, and the UI wasn't accessible, responsive, or consistent from page-to-page. I led a cross-functional team to redesign the navigation from the ground up, introducing a two-level system that reflects GitHub's information architecture and meets platform goals.

- Achieved >95% user satisfaction across 150M+ users
- Exposed information architecture to enable vertical and horizontal navigation
- Enabled integration of Copilot AI features across the platform
- Accessible and optimized for scale and maintenance
