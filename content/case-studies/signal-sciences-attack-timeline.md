Security teams couldn't quickly understand if they were under attack or what actions to take. The Events dashboard was nearly unusable—attack details were out of order and relationships between events were unclear. As the principal product designer, I created an industry-first "Attack Timeline" that visualized the attack lifecycle chronologically, making Signal Sciences' value proposition explicit.

- Reduced customer support tickets by 12%
- Increased sales demo conversion rate (became competitive differentiator)
- Designed and shipped as employee #30 at Series B startup → $775M acquisition
- Created comprehensive flowchart of all event states to handle edge cases
- Worked at intersection of business logic, UI, and backend data model
- Marketing team highlighted feature in every enterprise demo
