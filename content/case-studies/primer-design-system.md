Primer, GitHub's design system, was struggling: only 9% adoption among pages, unclear roadmap, and teams were building duplicate components (like 3 different date pickers 😰). I reset the product strategy by prioritizing high-impact React components, created a "shared component library" as a middle layer between Primer and custom code, and authored the org-wide strategy guide that became the source of truth for all front-end engineers.

- Grew Primer adoption from 9% to 90% across GitHub's core UI
- Scaled shared React component library by 7x through inner-sourcing model
- Authored canonical shared component strategy guide
- Consolidated implementations, including foundational patterns like lists and filters
- Conducted listening tour with 7 product teams to identify adoption blockers
