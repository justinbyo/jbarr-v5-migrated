GitHub's home dashboard had a reputation problem. Despite 2M daily visitors, users loudly complained it lacked utility and GitHub was stuck with no meaningful improvements for years. I led over 20 cross-functional contributors to reimagine and execute an ambitious redesign in a matter of weeks.

- Fixed long-standing perception problem: "Damn. Nice."
- Added 10k+ daily users during public preview with over >90% positive feedback
- Integrated Copilot agent orchestration for AI-assisted task management
- Surfaced core workflows for pull requests and issue navigation
