As Signal Sciences scaled from 30 customers to 500+, the navigation became unusable for enterprise teams managing 10+ sites. I redesigned the dashboard with a two-level navigation system that exposed the corp/site hierarchy, established analytics tracking standards, and identified "power users" for targeted research.

- Reduced support tickets by 12% by surfacing frequently used features
- Increased sales conversion during demos with clearer information architecture
- Enabled platform to scale from single-site use cases to Fortune 500 deployments
- Established analytics tracking standards (page-name, component-action, target) adopted company-wide
- Identified enterprise "power users" (8+ sites, 400+ sessions/month) for targeted testing
- Prepared infrastructure for 40,000 apps monitoring 2 trillion requests/month
